# PyBer - Rideshare Company Analysis

## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze ride transaction data of a popular ride sharing company "PyBer". By using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib, we were instructed to create a multi-lined graph to show PyBer the total weekly fares for each city type, Urban, Suburban and Rural as well as a summary data frame of the information gathered from the data that was given to us. Finally, a written report has to be submitted that summarizes the findings as well as how each city types differs from one another and how these findings can be used by the decision makers at PyBer.

## Results
The table below provides a quick summary of the differences in ride-sharing data for different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. Some of the key observations are:

1. The urban cities have the greatest number of total rides, driver and fares, but the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
2. The suburban cities are in the middle of the two other city types. The data presented tells us that it is more costly to receive a ride in rural cities compared to urban cities. There are more drivers available to catch a ride in urban cities compared to rural cities.
3. Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride out of the three city types. However, rural cities make up only 6.8% of the total revenue.
4. Rural cities have only 2.6% of the total driver population with an average fare per driver of $8.06 which is 12 times the fare per driver of
urban cities. This provides PyBer the opportunity to increase driver support in rural areas and further increase its revenue. Investment in rural areas will provide more growth opportunity compared to the same investment in urban cities.

The above graph is a visual representation of the ride share data for the PyBer Fare by City Type. For all city types, there are a few spikes in terms of the fare. Like the summary table, this graph also shows that the majority of the fare being generated comes mostly from urban cities, then suburban cities and lastly, rural cities. Grasping information from both the summary table and the graph, it is clear that the average fare for a ride in rural cities is the highest, but the most money being generated is in urban cities.

## Summary
### Business Recommendations to the CEO for addressing disparities among the city types
-	Based on the results from this analysis, one recommendation that can be given is considering the total length of the ride. Depending on how far the driver is taking the passenger, this could also be the reason why the average fare per ride in rural cities is high and in urban cities is low.
-	Performing a comparison of the data to include drivers per capita. Due to the lower number of drivers in rural cities compared to suburban and urban cities, it would be interesting to compare the city types to the ratio of drivers per capita. 
-	Lastly clearly define the criteria as to what makes a city urban, suburban or rural. Currently, we are just relying on the data provided, but it would have made the data more accurate if there was a clear criteria to categorize a city as urban, suburban or rural.
